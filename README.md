# DeepLearningFromScratch

The idea of this repository is to understand the inner working of deep learning. 
It offers the basic calculations needed for all layers and activations. 

To try it, clone the repo, install the requirements and start "Iris_Test_Model.py", 
You should see the training ongoing for 2000 iterations on the famous IRIS Dataset (available in this repo)

Feel free to modify the Iris_Test_Model file to try different networks.
